### Hi there 👋

**berpress/berpress** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I am currently working as an automated testing specialist and teaching students.
- ⚙️ I use daily: Python/JS/TS/Pytest/Playwright/GitLab/Docker


These repositories will help you learn test automation
